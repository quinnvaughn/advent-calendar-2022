I'm currently going through the Advent of Code calendar from 2022 to practice my problem solving skills. All days will be done in TS, and I might go back and do them in another language each day as well for the practice.

Most of these will only contain the code from part two, because I am lazy and didn't want to recreate code to show the second answer as well.
